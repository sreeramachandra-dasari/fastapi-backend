    <em>FastAPI template with JWT auth, PostgreSQL, and Docker Compose for rapid API development.</em>
 </p>
 
<br />

## Features

- **FastAPI**: A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM tool. Following SQLAlchemy's version 2 approach for defining models
- **Alembic**: Manages database migrations.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and scalable database system.
- **Docker**: Provides containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Unit Testing with Pytest**: Ensures code quality and reliability through effective testing.
- **User Authentication with JWT**: Implements secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Modular Structure**: Organizes the project for maintainability and scalability.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aLmktr/fastapi-blueprint.git
   ```

2. **Step into the project:**

   ```bash
   cd fastapi-blueprint 
   ```

3. **Update the `.env.test` file by setting the DB_PASS and SECRET_KEY (using hashes is recommended). Then, rename the file to `.env`**


4. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **That's it! now you can find your API docs here [localhost:8000/docs](http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs)**

<br />

### Note
- For security reasons, we have not included any method to create a superuser via the API. To create the first superuser, please follow these steps:
1. Create a normal user using the `create/` API endpoint.
2. Access the database using Docker by running:
```bash
docker exec -it fastapi_blueprint_db psql -U root -d fastapi_blueprint_db
```
3. Run the following SQL command to update the user role:
```sql
UPDATE users SET role='ADMIN' WHERE username='your_username_here';
```
4. Exit the database by running `\q`.
- Once these steps are completed, you are ready to proceed with managing your application.

## Extending the App
Say, for example, you want to use this template for a shop and add functionality for managing items. You can do this by following these steps:

1. **Create a new folder for the items functionality inside api folder `api/items` organize the folder as follow:**
```bash

└── 📁 items
     ├── 📄 __init__.py 
     ├── 📄 crud.py           
     ├── 📄 models.py         
     ├── 📄 schemas.py        
     └── 📄 item_routes.py  

```

2. **Write your database models:**
In the `models.py` file within the `items` folder, define your database models for the items functionality.

3. **Add model imports to Alembic for migrations:**
After writing your models, open the `migrations/env.py` file and add the following line under the user model import to ensure Alembic recognizes your items models:
```python

"""
Import all models here to ensure they are included in the migration
"""
from api.user import models  # noqa
from api.items import models # noqa  <-------- this line 

target_metadata = Base.metadata

```

4. **Run the migration:**
Make sure your container is running, then apply the migrations by running:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add items models"
alembic upgrade head 
```

5. **You're ready to go!**
Now you can start working on your new items functionality or any other feature for your app!
